# Etch-a-Sketch
Odin Project Curriculum Exercise
Instructions were to build an Etch-a-Sketch site using javascript DOM manipulation and event listeners. All html, Css and javascript made from scratch. 

Followed exercise prompts but instead of having the "Rainbow" button create random colors for each square, I thought it would look nicer if it actually followed a rainbow spectrum.
